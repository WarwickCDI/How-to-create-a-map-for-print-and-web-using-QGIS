At the same time 2nd PLT SPd from FB MF and moved south establishing BP ANGEL and searching from the north.  The clear operation lasted until 0822Z when the patrol began its movement back to FB Pathfinder.  During the search the ANP detained 14 suspicious individuals all of whom were entered into the HIIDE system by Pathfinder 2.  The personnel were detained as ANA and ANP were clearing through the compounds on OBJ Snake.  1 individual was detained because he had a shotgun, and several others were detained because they were attempting to run from the ANSF.  It is unknown whether the detainees are actually involved in insurgent activities or were just scared by the presence of ANSF.  The detainees were escorted by the ANP and the PMTs back to the Highway Patrol station in Nijrab.  

Other items of note which were confiscated by ANP were expended tank and artillery shell casings.  The MWD Team alerted the search elements to the presence of the residue in these expended casings.  The casings were confiscated to prevent their possible use as IEDs.

During KLEs with village leadership, Pathfinder 6 discussed the frequency in which Taliban forces have staged attacks from the Landikhel  Jalokheyl area.  He stated that if attacks continue, the ANSF/CF would be forced to continue to search these villages.  The Taliban ambushes are putting the people in danger, by forcing the ANSF/CF to return fire at Taliban insurgents that seek cover amongst the village.  It is the responsibility of the village elders to deny safe-haven and support to the Taliban, as well as to report suspected Taliban members to ANSF, NDS, or CF.  The village elders agreed with this, however, maintained that they are defenseless against the Taliban, and fear approaching ANSF/CF because they may become victims of Taliban retribution.  

The overall sentiment of the villagers was not hostile.  When asked if there was any contraband weapons, ammunition, or explosives, they answered no and ANSF were invited in to search the properties.  The MWD only alerted to residue from the aforementioned expended shell casings.

The patrol returned to FB Pathfinder at 0848Z while Dominion 5 escorted the 14 detainees to the highway station.  The detainees were entered into Dominions HIIDE system because Pathfinders HIIDE had a dead battery.

Taliban militants, facilitators detained in Zabul


BAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan  Coalition forces detained 10 adult males after raids on multiple compounds in the Qalat district of the Zabul Province early this morning.
	Credible evidence led the forces to the compounds, where the detainees are suspected of facilitating foreign fighters working for the Taliban.  Coalition forces were targeting known Taliban commanders and sub-commanders who organize attacks on Coalition forces and peaceful Afghans in the Zabul province.
These men are acknowledged facilitators for the Taliban in the area, said Coalition spokesman, Maj. Christopher Belcher.  They have pushed their way into the homes of locals, demanding food and shelter, putting innocent families in danger.
	There were no injuries during the operation.

On 9 OCT, TF Eagle (HHC) and ANA conducted a patrol to secure the Sarobi District Center. The district center has been the subject of reports that indicate Taliban Commander Zanzirs fighters plan to attack it before the end of Ramadan.  In the Sarobi Bazaar, HHC identified an ABP Hilux truck with tinted windows. When HHC and ANA personnel approached the vehicle, the ABP truck sped off.  HHC and ANA then found Ali Mohammed (son of Haji Mohammed) with two bodyguards, Ghul Mohammed (brother of Haji Mohammed), and 10 other individuals posing as ABP in the Sarobi bazaar. ANA detained the impostors and Haji Mohammeds relatives. The impostors were active members of the former corrupt Gomal ABP cell under Haji Mohammed; they have simply continued their corrupt practices in the absence of their former leader.  Ali Mohammed has direct financial ties to Al Qaeda and regular contact/business practices with Taliban Commander Zanzir; Ali Muhammed is known to finance terrorist activities throughout Paktika through his Al Qaeda contacts in the UAE. Since his fathers arrest, he has reportedly contacted General Hamid about firing the Tillman ABP commander, who has halted his illegal taxing of jingle trucks (which funded many of his joint ventures with Zanzir). The detained individuals posing as ABP wore ABP uniforms and carried AMD 65s (Hungarian AK 47s) and AK 47s.  FOB Orgun ABP mentors have identified by serial number that three of the confiscated weapons belong to the ABP.

On 10 OCT, the Sarobi shura met with HHC Commander and asked for the release of all detainees.

As TF 3 Fury continued to observe feed on the rover, the PAX were observed running wire to what appeared to be a battery pack. After running the wire to the side of the road, the PAX were seen packing the dirt. After emplacement of the IED was finished PAX began to make way to their vehicle in order to exfil the area of emplacement. CAS over watching the area conducted 2x gun runs to interdict enemy exfil.

2/B (QRF) was directed to conduct BDA assessment of vehicle and search for any enemy survivors. 
At 1640z, 2/B arrived on site and began conducting initial BDA assessment. 2/B reported 3x PAX EKIA (seemed melted to the seats in the vehicle) along with 1x RPG launcher, 3xAK-47 and 5 RPG rounds found inside.  Meanwhile, TF 3Fury TOC continued to observer 1xLN male prior to 2/B&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s arrival.  The individual walked to the vehicle that was engaged earlier, walked toward where the IED was emplace, and continued to walk further 1km SW of destroyed vehicle until he met up with 8 additional pax at grid (42S WC 10762 15436). CAS observed all PAX moving towards 3 separate qalats (qalat 1. WC 10584 15354, 2. WC 10439 15591, and 3. WC 11692 15529 which was the closest to IED emplacement site). 

TF 3 Fury coordinated for ODA, Polish and ANSF, to support C&amp;amp;amp;S of reported qalats while 3 Fury elements (2/B &amp;amp;amp; 3/B w/ Polish ETTs and ANA) would act as QRF support if needed.  

Between 2038z- 2104z ODA TM and 2x ANP elements ISO TF 3 Fury Ops breached through qalats 1&amp;amp;amp;2. Immediately, breach teams subdued personnel inside of the compound and began tactical questioning. TF 3 Fury, observing operation through ISR (shadow) asset, identified 1x additional qalat (designated qalat 4), approx. 100 meters N. of qalat 2. Once complete of C&amp;amp;amp;S of qalats 1&amp;amp;amp;2, ODA w/ ANP elements made way to additional qalat. ODA later reported once C&amp;amp;amp;S was completed of qalat 4 that 5x LN males were occupying the compound at the time of search. Of note, the terp with ODA TM identified 1 of the 5 LN males to be the brother of a Taliban member in the Paktya province. ANP w/ ODA took the 1 local national male into custody for further interrogation. 

At 2326z, C&amp;amp;amp;S mission was completed with a roll up of 9 additional LN military fighting age males who were later turned over to the NDS HQ for further interrogation and entry into the HIIDE system.

At 0127z 3/B w/ Polish ETTs and ANA elements completed C&amp;amp;amp;S of qalat 3 with nothing significant found. At 0227z, TF 3 Fury declared event closed with NFTR.

Analysis: This event took place approximately 2km SW of Chawni village along RTE Virginia on a stretch of road that has seen 6 PPIED events, 2 direct fire engagements, and an indirect fire attack since August 2007. The emplacers were following the previously established TTP of burying IEDs near a culvert or natural wash out in the road. Chawni is assessed to be a key village in the Zormat early warning network. This group of insurgents was likely preparing the explosive and trigger devices for the IEDs in order to target Coalition formations moving from Gardez to Zormat, with the intent to attach the battery pack when given early warning from insurgents in Chawni.  Since this PPIED was emplaced in the northern IED killbox on RTE Virginia, it was likely targeting first responders.  There is likely another PPIED further Southwest on RTE Virginia meant to be the initial strike on a CF patrol.

FM TF PALADIN:

As the Team was returning to FOB Gardez, patrol was notified CAS spotted three enemy fighters emplacing an IED along Rte Virginia.  As the enemy was trying to exfil the area, their car was engaged by 220 rds of 30mm from the A-10 that spotted them.  EOD Team and patrol were called to the site to over-watch the IED/destroyed enemy vehicle, then safe the IED at first light.  Team searched general IED location (given by A-10 pilot) with Talon for 45 minutes with negative find.  Team Leader approached in Bomb Suit and searched area with MIMID for 20 minutes before finding an unarmed PPIED.  Team remotely separated components, then placed a counter charge on the IEDs main charge, 1ea TC-6 AT landmine. Team searched the area and found no additional hazards.  Team then searched the enemy vehicle for any explosive hazards, so it could be recovered to FOB Gardez.  In the vehicle, Team found and removed 5ea low-ordered RPGs, 4ea AK-47, 1ea RPG launcher, and assorted burnt/expended ammo.  All evidence was collected for turn in to CEXC.

PALADIN Observation:

-Same type of Pressure Plate has been present in over 20 incidents around this area since 17 Aug 07 (FUSION NET: 2007-229-100032-0631, 2007-229-055730-0106, 2007-249-150938-0385, 2007-268-041000-0486, 2007-268-085412-0074, 2007-269-120644-0147, 2007-271-044956-0289, 2007-272-124949-0938, 2007-275-044341-0526 etc.)

-A slightly modified TTP for the Zormat area was discovered on this PPIED - The battery Pack was buried next to the Pressure Plate in the road, then 3 meters of wire was ran from the battery pack/pressure plate off the side of the road and left un-shunted and insulated with pieces of plastic bag.  Once CF arrived in the area the insulation would be removed and the wires twisted together to arm the PPIED, thus allowing less time on target for ACM.

-Another Slightly Modified TTP of placing the IED 10 Meters before a culvert might also be in response to RCP and other convoys doing thorough checks for IEDs around chokepoints.

The Husky moved forward and the Buffalo vehicle began interrogating the site with its arm. As the Buffalo was beginning to make its first pass over the site, the IED detonated underneath the arm. Immediately after the detonation, an RPG was fired towards the patrol from the vicinity of the hilltop to the north of the patrols location. Three more RPG rounds were fired rapidly at the convoy from an insurgent crouching in a hole approximately 50m south of the road. Seven Soldiers dismounted their vehicles and maneuvered on the insurgent, killing him with small arms fire. The patrol established security at the site and detained approximately nine personnel working at the nearby rock quarry approximately 150m away from the firing position of the insurgent. The patrol also searched the house in the rock quarry; in which they found 2 x AK-47s with 10 magazines and 1x .303 British rifle and 18 D-cell batteries.
Fearless 6 patrol arrived on site from the Terezai DC and began enrolling the detainees in the HIIDE system. EOD began their post-blast investigation of the site.

(S) Mission: O/O SOTF conducts kinetic strike followed with HAF raid to kill/capture ABU LAYTH AL LIBI on NAI 2.

(S)Target: Abu Layth Al Libi is a senior al-Qaida military commander, Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) leader.  He is based in Mir Ali, Pakistan and runs training camps throughout North Waziristan.  Collection over the past week indicates a concentration of Arabs IVO objective area. 

Result: 6 x EKIA; 7 x NC KIA, 7 x detainees 

(S) Summary: HAF departed for Orgun-E to conduct link-up and posture to the objective immediately after pre-assault fires.  On order, 5 rockets were launched and destroyed structures on the objective (NAI 2).  The HAF quickly inserted the assault force into the HLZ.  ISR reported multiple UIMs leaving the objective area.  The assault force quickly conducted dismounted movement to the target area and established containment on the south side of the objective.  During the initial assault, dedicated air assets engaged multiple MAMs squirting off the objective area.  GFC assessed 3 x EKIA squirters north and 3 x EKIA squirters south of the compound were neutralized from air asset fires.  The assault force quickly maneuvered with a SQD element on the remaining squirters.  The squirter element detained 12 x MAMs and returned to the objective area.  GFC passed initial assessment of 7 x NC KIA (children).  During initial questioning, it was assessed that the children were not allowed out of the building, due to UIMs presence within the compound.  The assault force was able to uncover 1 x NC child from the rubble.  The MED TM immediately cleared debris form the mouth and performed CPR to revive  the child for 20 minutes.  Due to time restrictions, TF CDR launched QRF element to action a follow-on target (NAI 5).  They quickly contained the objective and initiated the assault.  The objective was secured and the assault force initially detained 6 x MAMs.  The GFC recommended that 7 MAMs be detained for additional questioning.  The TF CDR assessed that the assault force will continue SSE.  The local governor was notified of the current situation and requests for assistance were made to cordon the AO with support from ANP and local coalition forces in search of HVI.

PAKTIKA GOVERNOR Location next 24hrs and districts visited this week- Governor Khpalwak is currently in SHARAN at his compound.  He visited the following districts this week: SHARAN, YAYA KHEL, and the city of KABUL.

Military: (S//REL)  NSTR

Economic: (S//REL)  NSTR

Security:  (S//REL)  Coalition forces conducted a non-kinetic operation in northern Baki Khel this morning that resulted in the rescue of two hostages, one of which is an AUP soldier working in Yaya Khel, and two women and five children.  A third hostage was also rescued but continued to be detained by CF after he may have been assessed to be an insurgent and not a hostage.  Eight ACM were killed and seven were detained at the conclusion of the operation.  It is currently assessed that the two AUP soldiers kidnapped in Yaya Khel on 16 June, were being held in the NAI focus of the operation.  One of the AUP soldiers being held hostage was killed during the attack.  

Infrastructure: (S//REL)  Engineering conducted weekly progress meeting with contractor for the ORGUN CEE and work is progressing along very well.  Contractor Kaliq Dad also presented a design for a 10 room school (Madrassa) in SAR HAWZA, bid is expected within 7 days or sooner.  Another design/cost (per m3) was also submitted for a typical flood retention wall, which engineering will incorporate into an IDIQ contract to cover multiple sites beginning in the SHARANA vicinity.  Contractor was also introduced to the ORGUN Hospital expansion project and will be conducting a complete survey of what is existing and will submit a new design and cost estimate to PRT.

Information: (U//REL)  Engineering was in contact with VOP (Voice of Paktika) and their system is back up and running and began broadcasting at 1600 local.  Due to the successful raid that was conducted by ANSF and CF, we developed a story that will be broadcasted over Voice of Paktika once it is back on the air:  

The Afghan National Security Forces and Coalition Forces conducted a very successful joint operation against a suspected Taliban safe house in the BAKI KHEL District of Paktika Province on the 20th of June.  The raid resulted in freeing two hostages, killing seven ACM, and detaining another seven ACM.  The seven detained ACM are currently in US Custody.  Also freed in the raid were two females and five children.  A significant weapons cache was found near the safe house to include PKMs, RPGs, AK-47s, grenades.  One of the ACM killed was wearing a suicide vest.  One of the hostages name is Ismayel and he was a contract policeman from Paktia that worked with the Afghan National Police in YAYA KHEL District.  He was kidnapped by the Taliban on 16 June during the Taliban attack against the District Center.  The name of the second hostage is Rahmatullah.  He is the son of a Head Master of a school in Paktia Province.  Rahmatullah was reportedly kidnapped on 13 June in Paktia Province.  The Taliban were using him as a tool to get to his father, whom they intended to kill for working with the Government.  Both hostages had been blindfolded and restrained by the Taliban.  The freed hostages were handed over to Akram Khaplawak, the Governor of Paktika, by CDR Fernandez, the Provincial Reconstruction Team Commanding Officer.  The Provincial Reconstruction Team provided immediate Humanitarian Assistance to the freed hostages.  The Governor will return Ismayel and Rahmatullah to their respective families.

(U//REL) The PRT interpreters were monitoring TOLO TV News this afternoon.  TOLO TV News reported that seven ACM were killed, seven ACM were arrested, and two hostages were freed by joint operation consisting of ANSF and CF.

EOD REPORT:

755A/3 was notified of an IED strike against Task Force 10. Team departed FOB Sayed Abad with CIED 16 to conduct post blast investigation. Upon arrival 5/25's were conducted and 360 degree scene security was verified and re-enforced with US forces. EOD TL linked up with OSC and learned: While traveling southbound on HWY 1/RTE Ohio with an eight vehicle convoy at approximately 45 mph the sixth vehicle (RG33) was struck by an IED. The vehicle was thrown airborne and impacted the western side of HWY 1/RTE Ohio near a dirt bypass. Two casualties had been Medevac'd and two additional casualties would be Casevac'd. Two AH-64's were on station at the time of detonation and immediately began a search for observers/triggermen. A security element had detained 7 MAM's with the help of the air support. EOD TM deployed a robotic platform and found no additional hazards near the SOE. A cursory search of the vehicles final resting position revealed no hazards. EOD TL dismounted with Vallon and verified no hazards were present and EOD began TSE. An EOD TM with security tactically bound the command wire and located the firing point at 42S VC 81410 86511. At the firing point a shoe was found, with nothing further of value. One of the MAM's detained only had one shoe and the shoe located at the firing point matched his missing shoe and the shoe prints were consistent around the firing point. Task Force 10 maintained possession of the shoe. Multiple charred fragments of yellow plastic jug were recovered near the SOE which measured 12' X 16' X 6' consistent with approximately 200lbs of UBE. The main charge was not placed in a culvert, but was dug into the road surface from the west. The command wire paralleled the road surface prior to turning and moving towards the firing point. The command wire was buried in the shoulder of the road surface and was buried the entire length to the firing point (approx 1600 Meters). From the SOE where the vehicle left the roadway the first point of impact was 45 meters away onto the CROW system. The vehicle rolled over and came to rest on the driver's side an additional 35 meters from first point of impact. Due to mechanical damage to the vehicle recovery assets with CIED 16 were unable to exfil the vehicle. Additional assets were requested from FOB Airborne. The CROW system was destroyed during the incident. EOD recovered several damaged .50 cal rounds for disposal at a later date. Once we received notification that additional recovery assets were en route, CIED 16 and EOD Team 3 RTB.",RC EAST,ENEMY,,TF East JOC Watch/TF SPARTAN,A CO 4STB,CF,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,42SVC8315286733,34.22151947,68.81708527,TF East JOC Watch,TF East JOC Watch,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Taliban militants, facilitators detained in Zabul


BAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan  Coalition forces detained five adult males after a raid on a compound in the Qalat district of the Zabul Province early this morning.
	Credible evidence led the forces to the compound, where the suspected militants had a man positioned on the roof with a two-way radio as a lookout.  Coalition forces entered the compound and two men fled the scene.  The forces took them into custody.  
The detainees are suspected of fighting and working for militants; one is an admitted Taliban extremist. 
Coalition forces inventoried the house, finding two AK-47s, an RPK machine gun, and two fragmentation grenades.  The weapons were removed to a safe place and destroyed.
Taliban fighters are working against the interest of peaceful Afghans, and their attempts to bring down the elected government will fail said Army Maj. Chris Belcher, a Coalition spokesman.  
	Warning shots were fired, but there were no injuries during the operation.

This particular operation sought members of an assassination cell known to target Islamic Republic of Afghanistan officials, said coalition spokesman, Maj. Chris Belcher.
The detainees will be questioned as to their identities and involvement in militant activities.

CCA had seen personnel down loading jingle trucks in caves vic that grid.  We set up an RP approximately 300 meters from the suspected jingle truck sight and put a dismounted patrol along the road.  We established overwatch over the wadi surrounding the area.  While attempting to find another cave to the west, we saw a cave to our south with personnel in it.  After coming up short looking for jingle trucks, we decided to look into the cave to the South.  A man approached us from the cave and began telling a story about his truck breaking down.  ANA and CF were searching the area around the man while we were questioning him.  They found an AK-47, two pistols, marijuana, several sticks of explosives, det cord, a large number of D cell batteries, blasting caps, a notebook, a book of pictures and other personal items.  I then had the ANA place the men in flex cuffs and sit them down.  We brought them to Salerno.  
Of the four men, one is young, and one is older.  The fat man with the lazy eye was very quiet the whole time.  The old man did not seem to have anything to do with the situation.  I think the other three were using him to distract us from the cave with their equipment.  The young man was quiet as well.  The other male was somewhat young, and the leader.  He stated initially he was an Arbakai.  He requested we take the rifle to the Spera district center.  When I asked why he tried to hide the weapon from us, he would not provide an answer.  He made little attempt to argue once all the equipment was found.


4 individuals detained for questioning 
Items found in the cave: 
1 x AK47 
2 x pistols 
Magazines and ammunition accompanied the weapons 
Some type of material that is believed to be some form of explosives.  For xamination by TF Paladin: Wire  and a bag of Marajuana 
The individuals did not want the CF / ANA to find this property and were doing their best to hide it from our troops.
The individuals would not talk about what they were doing at the cave or who they were working with.
The cave is not as big / deep as it appeared from the sky.  Actually only about 5 meters deep.
D Co returns with the BDE TAC from Gardez on Tuesday.  Will build a more deliberate plan to get them into the area of this cave and look for others / the jingle trucks that were observed by the helo pilots.

After breaching the objective, the clearing element received effective small arms fire and fragmentation grenades from inside the target building.  5x US soldiers were wounded initially.  The ground forces then began to fire into the entrances of the compound and in the ensuing firefight 7x more US soldiers received minor shrapnel wounds.  The element pulled off of the objective with the wounded leaving an M-4 inside the compound.  The M-4 was in the engagement zone and ground forces were unable to reach it.  After the building was evacuated the ground commander simultaneously began setting up an HLZ for CASEVAC of the wounded and also initiated AC-130 fires on the target compound.  Once CASEVAC was completed 2x A-10s initiated fires on the compound dropping 2x GBU 12s (500lbs).  Following the bomb impacts secondary explosions and a fire were observed and were believed to have been caused by a buried munitions cache. TF 373 exfilled at 2246z and called QRF, C/2-508 (attached to TF White Eagle), to conduct SSE of the site.  The building was completely destroyed.

US, PBG and ANSF forces had all arrived on scene by 050230ZOCT07 and had begun SSE of the objective and a search in the village shortly thereafter.  The objective had been cleaned up and items hidden in what appeared to be an attempt to cover up the contact.  A motorcycle, exploded RPG rounds and machine gun links had been hidden underneath a blanket.  The owner of the bike is not known.  Additionally the M-4 with a PEQ-2A and an ACOG were found deliberately hidden underneath some brush along with a kit bag left by TF 373.  The kit bag contained some papers from the objective and a poncho liner.  Both the M-4 and kit bag have been turned over to TF 373.  The site also contained more exploded RPG rounds, small arms casings, 2x AK-47 magazines (empty) several Pakistani ID cards and various other documents.  During the search 4x males of military age believed to have knowledge about the contact were detained and have been transferred to the ANA Compound on FOB Waza Kwah for further questions from THT 45 and the NDS. 

6x KIA were found inside the compound. 1x adult female, 1x female child and 4x male adults, one of which was bound by zip cuffs.  Pictures of the compound and deceased have been taken and the finger printing of all deceased males has been conducted.  The bound man has been identified as the owner of the compound and it is believed that he was a prisoner/hostage of the ACM.

3x wounded LNs (1x 10 year old boy, 2x teenage girls) were brought to CF during the SSE and were CASEVACd to FOB Waza Kwah when 2Fury elements RTB.  One of the teenaged girls was MEDEVACd to FOB Salerno for treatment.  The other 2x wounded were released from FOB Waza Kwah at approximately 1230z.

The 12 US WIA are all in stable condition.  6x personnel are at BAF, 3 of which are RTD, while the other 6x personnel are at Orgun-E with the FST and the 373 surgeon still undergoing treatment.

BDA is as follows:

After they finished, the 5 individuals moved to a nearby qalat located at 42SWC9229801859 and bedded down for the night.  At this time, the FTF QRF and CIED TM SAL were sent out to search the qalat and interrogated the IED site.  During the search of the qalat the EOD TM was on stand by for any possible explosive hazards.  The FTF QRF rounded up 10 MAMs in the qalat and put 8 of the 10 into the HIIDE's.  During the initial questioning, 4x individuals were detained by the FTF QRF.  Once the search of the qalat was completed, the EOD TL with several dismounts, moved to the IED location.  The EOD TL performed a Command Wire sweep on both sides of Route Alaska.  When the EOD TL located the Command Wire, he bounded it to the firing point, while the robot was sent forward to interrogate the main charge.
At the firing point only a spool of alternator wire was found and the EOD TL cleard the area.  The robot uncovered the Command Wire on the road and traced it to the approximate location of the Main Charge.  While the robot was tracing the wire towards the Main Charge, it uncovered the battery pack and a circuit board.  Using the robot the EOD TM separated the battery pack and circuit board from the main charge.  The EOD TM was unable to uncover the actual main charge with the robot due to the depth it was buried, so the EOD TM placed a clearing charge in attempt to uncover the main charge.  After detonating the charge, the top of a TC-6 AT Landmine was uncovered.  Upon interrogation of the landmine, it was discovered that the clearing charge had fractured the shell of the Landmine and the robot was able to extract everything but the explosives from the landmine.  Upon further interrogation of the site, the robot found a second main charge consisting of a 30 lb basket of UBE.  The basket was unable to be removed remotely and was blown in place (BIP). Searching the area, no other IED components were found and the EOD TM collected the Command Wire, battery pack, circuit board and TC-6 case and RTB.

Gardez, 4 May: A middle school was extensively damaged in an overnight explosion in the southeastern Paktia Province, where the security situation has been fragile because of increasing Taleban-led insurgency.

The report stated that there was a pressure cooker full of explosives on the side of the road. There is a local mine clearing team in the area but the team is not equipped to deal with this IED threat. The governor also reports that the three men responsible for the emplacement of the IED have been arrested. The report also states that rockets were found in the homes of the men arrested. NFI ATT.


Report after incident close out:
(S//REL USA, GCTF, ISAF, NATO)  On 16 Sep 07, BAF CI, TF Gladius, CEXC, and EOD traveled to 1st Kohistan District, Kapisa Province, AF to retrieve, exploit, and further identify the background information on an IED setup inside the Khamzargar girls high school (IVO: 42SWD 3185) in 1st Kohistan District.  

(S//REL USA, ISAF, NATO)  EOD secured the pressure cooker and CEXC examined its contents.  I will let CEXC and EOD speak to their findings to ensure the greatest accuracy in reporting.  They also took photographs and seized the pressure cooker IED for further exploitation.  EOD then disposed of a warhead (approx 130mm) in place.

(S//REL USA, GCTF, ISAF, NATO)  The following information was obtained from BAF CI after the examination of the pressure cooker and the safe disposal of the warhead:

On 8 Sep 07 at approximately 0200hrs the NDS was alerted (via their source network) to the presence of 2-6 local national males planting an IED and an anti-tank mine in and around the 1st Kohistan District girls high school.  NDS had been alerted 1.5 months earlier on an attempted plot to smuggle a bomb from the Logar Province intended for a soft government target in Kapisa Province through their source network (NFI).  The two suspects in custody are MOKHTAR, son of JOMA KHAN, and Engineer ALI, son of FATEH MOHAMMED.  Upon a search of MOKHTARs home, four to five RPG-7 rockets were found on his roof.  No RPG launchers were discovered and no other bomb making materials were found.  No other documents were found (e.g. maps of targets, instructions for building weapons, etc.)  According to the NDS both suspects confessed to planting the IED and mine but would not provide information on anyone they were working with or who specifically was directing the attack.  The two witnesses to the IED emplacements were ALI MOHAMMED and KHAN MOHAMMED.  Both ALI and KHAN MOHAMMEDs are night grounds keepers for the girls school.  They were told by the suspects not to move from their huts/living quarters and they hid.  From the sound, the witnesses said 2-6 males emplaced the IED and mine.  Note: They did not visually observe the emplacements and/or the suspects.  The pressure cooker was buried approx. 20 cm under a staircase in the girls school.  On top of the pressure cooker IED (also buried) was the warhead (this was different than the original account the NDS provided us.)  Both the pressure cooker and warhead had wires attached to them when they were recovered from the school which the ANP cut before seizing.  The wires were also buried and led to an adjacent field. Neither the NDS nor ANP conducted a search of the field where the wires lead to for a detonator.  No detonator was ever recovered regarding this incident. 

(S//REL USA, ISAF, NATO) The NDS said they told the local television media (TV of Kapisa) of the discovery of the IED to help gain public support against the Anti Coalition Militia (ACM.)

(U) Inconsistencies:

(S//REL FVEY) The NDS originally said they responded to the IED being placed at 0100 hrs (local) on 8 Sep 07.  Today they said they were alerted of the IED being placed at 0200 hrs on 8 Sep 07 and then went and seized the IED at 0400hrs.  The NDS said they waited for sunrise to go into the school. 

(S//REL FVEY) Today the NDS said there were 2-6 suspects who planted the IED and mine.  They would not provide any identifying information on the other 4 suspects or how they suspected them to be involved with this incident.  TF Gladius and BAF CI were originally told three suspects were in custody on 8 Sep 07.

(S//REL FVEY) The NDS said they suspected the two suspects of working with the HIG. They also said they suspected the Taliban and HIG working together.  The TB was never mentioned during the first meeting with NDS, they said it was definitely HIG and denied any TB, AQ, or other groups involvement.    

(S//REL FVEY) On 14 Sep 07, the NDS said these suspects would be available at their Kohistan HQ Office on 16 Sep 07.  BAF CI was told these suspects were in Kabul and were turned over to the prosecutors office after 72 hrs since their arrest on 8 Sep 07.  The suspects biometrics therefore could not be obtained.

(S//REL FVEY) The two suspects arrested in this matter live in Kohistan and both have children.  They are suspected of placing an IED in a girls school approximately 1km from their house.  From our experience this is atypical behavior.

(S//REL FVEY) We gathered the baseline data on the IED and anti-tank mine being placed at the girls school.  However the finite details are very cloudy and the inconsistencies the NDS has presented either lead us to believe that they do not know all the facts or they are not providing all the facts of this matter (e.g. not telling the truth.)  If you have any questions, please give us a shout.  

(S//REL USA, ISAF, NATO) We will place a DIIR out on this once we obtain the photographs from CEXC but we wanted to ensure all parties obtained the raw intelligence collected so they could use appropriately.  We will follow up with NDS on the inconsistencies to bring more light to the motivation behind this attack, who funded the attack, etc.  Thank you for your time.

S: Possible IED
A: notified EOD/CEXC/BAF CI
L: 42S WD 325 845
T: 0430Z 
R: The PRT reported the ANP arrested 3 individuals that were emplacing an IED in Kohistan, vic 42S WD 325 845, in the village of Darsidi. BDOC informed CEXC, BAF CI, and EOD. The ANP secured IED and relocated it to a safe area. At ~1130Z after linking up with the ANP and NDS CEXC was able to photograph and look at what appeared to be a pressure cooker IED. The NDS would not let CEXC exploit the IED because they claimed they wanted to show it to the locals to inform them what the enemy was doing. CI tried to convince them to let them take it and of how dangerous it was however they would not. The NDS also informed us that they found 2 RPGs in the individuals house where the wire for the IED was coming from and an AT mine in the middle of the road. The AT mine was suspected to be set up to go off when the first responders arrived after the IED went off. CI will provide a complete report after they return to BAF.
=====================================================

CI report

(S//REL USA, ISAF, GTCF, NATO) On 8 Sep 07 at approximately 1045hrs (local), BAF CI, TF Gladius, the Combined Explosive Exploitation Cell (CEXC), and 755th AEG/Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team responded to an IED seized prior to its explosion by the NDS and ANP. 

(S//REL USA, ISAF, NATO) On 8 Sep 07, BAF CI interviewed Gen Najib, NDS, regarding the chain of events involved with the IED. Najib provided the following information: 

(S//REL USA, ISAF, NATO) On 8 Sep 07 at approximately 0100hrs (local), the ANP responded to an IED placed in a metal pressure cooker with white wires coming out of it. The NDS stated they were made aware of the emplacement of the IED by their source network and the local populace was warned that the school would be closed on 8 Sep 07 (NFI). The IED was placed under the stairs near the corridor entrance of a Khamzargar girls high school IVO: 42SWD 3185. The wire from the IED went through the wall and went to an adjacent field. Note: BAF CI was originally told the wires went to an adjacent field and that no means of detonation was observed. Later, BAF CI was told the wires went through the field to the suspects house located approximately 1km form the school (but no means of detonation was discovered.) Two suspects were arrested and are being questioned by NDS. The two suspects were identified as MUKHTAR, son of MAZJEDI and ALI MOHAMMED, son of FATAH MOHAMMED. Both these individuals are villagers of Khamzargar area near the school. NDS suspected them of being HIG members and did not know who had directed the attack on the girls school or the motive for such an attack. These suspects were arrested at MUKHTARs house which was subsequently searched. Subsequent to the search, four RPG-7 rockets were discovered and seized by the ANP and the two suspected were turned over to the NDS. BAF CI was not permitted to question these individuals. Note: Originally BAF CI was informed three suspects were arrested, however NDS stated on two were arrested and were in custody.

(S//REL USA, ISAF, GTCF, NATO) One pressure plate, anti-tank mine was also discovered in the dirt road near the school. The NDS opined the attackers were targeting the ANP first responders after the explosion in the girls school detonated. The mine was taken to the ANP Kapisa Province ANP Headquarters IVO: 42SWD 3176. The mine was described as approximately one foot in length, six inches in width, metal, and either dark green or brown. The mine was buried in the dirt road and was concealed by dirt when the ANP seized it. 

(S//REL USA, ISAF, GTCF, NATO) The IED, associated wires, and a currently unknown warhead are located at the NDS HQ at Shir Khan Kheyl village IVO 42SWD 2748. The NDS cut the wires to the pressure cooker/IED but did not further tamper or investigate the contents of the pressure cooker. The NDS wants to publicize the IED and the nefarious plan to attack the girls school to the local populace. After they have exploited the media value of the IED emplacement, they would like Coalition Forces to dispose of the bomb. Due to this fact, CEXC and EOD could not clear the IED and/or confirm if there were explosives within the pressure cooker. CEXC was unable to gather fingerprints and exploit the IED due to the unknown nature of the IED. The NDS said they would call LTC Leary, TF Gladius/CC, once they were done exploiting the media value of the IED.

(S//REL USA, ISAF, GTCF, NATO) The anti-tank mine and four RPG-7 rockets are located at the Kapisa Province ANP Headquarters and have not been destroyed.

POI was 50m East of ANA portion of FOB, and the POO site was a white school in Shembowat village (42S WB 684919). US ETTs and ANA took 3 ACM into custody at POO site. Additionally, there was a 2nd rocket at same grid the timer reads 1100, set to go off at 2000 and was pointed at Camp Clark. There was an immediate request for assistance from Fury/Paladin to insert by air support IOT render rocket safe. It is  believed that the ACM did not account for AM/PM difference, hence the reason the rocket went off during daylight. ISAF Tracking # 10-278.

TF Professional Report:

This came to us via CC/DOS/Gov conversation 15 Oct 07.  Maulawi Mohammed Khan plus 2 accomplices were arrested Friday 12 Oct 07 near 
42S  WE  43364  03379 approx .5 miles south of the Governor of Panjshirs complex, attempting to implant an IED.  Supposed targets were, in this order Gov, NDS Chief, PRT.  From the description it would have been manually detonated via hard wire.  It was to be planted on the side of the road.  Explosive had been removed from other munitions NFI. Subjects are currently in Kabul under arrest.  No further information at this time.  Will keep you informed as we attempt to learn more.

***Update***
Kabul NDS actually apprehended MMK in Panjshir as they were doing patrols in the area (Eid patrols), therefore, there was not transfer from the Panjshir NDS as the Kabul NDS actually made the capture.  The device was described as an ammo crate full of 82mm Mortars with explosive materials intermingled.  A crude blasting cap requiring manual actuation via wires being held together to close circuit for detonation.  MMK is being held in Kabul indefinitely pending investigation, however, local NDS doesnt expect that he will ever be released and if he is it will be into possible coalition custody.  As an important point, many of the prominent Panjshiris are extremely embarrassed/disturbed because MMK comes from Bazarak/Paranday which is the home to many prominent Panjshiris (Abdul Saleh (NDS Natl Dir), First VP Massoud, Senator Itzatyar (PM)).  PRT received visit from concerned elders that heard about Mullah Mohammed ((KHAN)) (MMK) attempt to plant IED near the road in order to target the Governor or PRT.

The 3rd Regimental Field Squadron (RFS), Royal Air Force (UK) requested EOD and CEXC assistance.  A coordination meeting was held at the JDOC and it was determined that due to the low-light conditions and the pending arrival of nightfall, the Field Squadron would coordinate a security cordon of the area and that EOD and CEXC would deploy the following morning at first light to neutralize the IED.  On 210230ZAPR08, EOD and CEXC deployed with a security convoy dedicated from the 3rd RFS.  Photographic intelligence obtained from the 3rd RFS indicated that there was a TC-6 AT landmine with det cord buried in the middle of a route utilized by the 3rd RFS.  Once on scene, EOD deployed its Talon robot to investigate the IED and determine what the det cord was connected to.  The robot attempted to trace the det cord from the TC-6 AT mine to the unknown secondary charge buried adjacent to the AT mine.  During this procedure, the det cord was unintentionally pulled out of the secondary charge.  EOD recovered the det cord which was later turned over to CEXC.  With the secondary charge still unknown at this time, EOD then placed a TNT exploratory charge approximately three feet away from the TC-6 AT mine.  The intent of this charge was to expose the unknown secondary charge while preventing a sympathetic detonation of the TC-6 AT mine.  The TNT charge initiated a 122mm projectile which was identified as the secondary charge buried adjacent to the TC-6 AT mine.  At the same time, the resultant blast, sympathetically detonated the TC-6 AT mine as well.  As a result, the IED was rendered safe through detonation rather than disruption and the scene was cleared by EOD.  CEXC conducted the post blast investigation and exploited the scene.  Evidence was collected and returned to CEXC.

Narrative of Major Events: 
AZ76 calls out with Slayer Toc to exit ROZ SAPEK. Slayer Toc requests that we contact Duke 07 on 47.650 as they have no direct contact with that unit.  AMC orders orbit in place to contact Duke element VIC 41R QQ 537 977. Contact established, Duke reports contact with approximately 25-30 AAF VIC 41R QQ 474 948, and that they have wounded ANP. Report that the AAF escaped in a white Toyota corolla around the other side of the mountain. AZ element continues towards Duke element and PIDs Duke element on north side of mountain.  AZ continues around to south of mountain, looking for white Corolla. Lead and trail both ID ANP forces along road on south side of mountain, carrying weapons in defensive positions directed SW. Trail IDs white Corolla driving rapidly down road, and watches as it stops at 41R QQ 4658 9309 and 5-8 people run from behind a dirt wall on the north side and try to enter the vehicle.  As AAF load car, lead PIDs weapons on PAX, and as aircraft passes to the west, AAF fire rounds at lead, who breaks right.  Car accelerates rapidly to the southwest down the road, trail contacts Duke 07 with PID, and requests permission to fire.  Duke 07 give clearance of fires, lead engages vehicle resulting in mobility kill.  All AAF exit vehicle and jump into ravine on north side of road, four continue south, two remain vicinity of car.  Lead maneuvers to fire directly down ditch, trail follows, 1 AAF dead in ditch.  Trail IDs one PAX exit the ditch VIC vehicle and begins to walk east into fields.  Trail fires WP rocket into ditch killing one, lead engages ditch as two additional attempt to cross small bridge over ditch near well head.  Lead receives small arms fire from two, PID PKM in ditch, and breaks right.  Lead maneuvers to engage single AAF in east field with M4- groin hit, resulting in KIA.  Lead reengages ditch as one AAF tries to climb out and cross road to the south, Lead engages with .50, wounds, later kills one AAF.  1 AAF identified who was still in a ditch, was engaged by lead with M4, resulting in 1 EKIA.  Trail IDs one AAF with blue cover in ditch VIC car, engages with M4, no effects.  Trail updates Slayer, ISR reported on station.  Trail updates Duke 07, who has stuck or broken vehicle on road to the north, IDs ANP maneuvering to join battle to the NE.  WT Breaks station for FARP. SWT conducts relief in place brief over team internal with SWT (AZ74) in FARP.  CM2RI team arrived on station and established communication with Duke 6 element which currently had all vehicles fixed by enemy fire from the north.  They directed us to where their last contact had come from and said that as we came on station the fire had ceased and they believed that the insurgents egressed to the SE.  Team made contact with two individuals with description and marked with smoke.  Upon marking position, individuals hid from aircraft and tried to flee the area.  Team received clearance of fire from Duke 6 and engaged personnel.  Team continued to observe one personnel to the south but lost contact due to other individuals in the OBJ area.  Team walked Duke and Cowboy elements onto KIAs and walked them onto compounds of interest relayed by ISR.  Team continued to provide aerial security and get good SA on entire TIC.  Team then observed individuals to the east and directed ISR onto area. Team then observed 3 x FAMs south of OBJ area hiding under small WADI bridge.  Walked Cowboy elements onto FAMs and Cowboy detained FAMs. Team continued to observe area and provide security until all friendly elements broke station.	
TF WINGS S2 Assessment: The engagement was deliberate and planned by AAF to ambush ground forces in the area. It is a common TTP that AAF would break contact before CAS comes on station. Due the closeness of the engagement to KAF, OH-58s were quick to respond and engaged the AAF. As the AAF were egressing from CF aircraft, they shot at the aircraft to force the pilots to maneuver, which would give time to escape. AAF used the grape lines as cover from OH-58 fire which is known to make it difficult for a successful hit. Expect more frequent engagements on ground forces as weather continues to improve and weapons shipments make resources available. AAF will take TOO SAFIREs as aircraft respond to TICs.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,TF WINGS,,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5,3,41RQQ46589309,31.54644775,65.597435,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,A SIGACTS MANAGER,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Summary of Events
SI led CF and ANSF to location. FMV was over target location via CAS.  While CAS was reported no individuals  left the area.

Isolation team reached objective and isolation was established within 2 minutes. There was no SI Lock on the objective, there were three MAMs present. Through TQ Romeo 01 was given the name, RHAMATULLAH; which correlates with the name currently being tracked for OBJ Granite Peak. The call was made that all three would be detained and brought back to FOB Salerno for HUMINT exploitation. 

HCT 08 conducted the TQ and ascertained all three were being deceptive, with one possibly being a hard-line Taliban follower. SSE on the objective was cold. 

Based off of TQ a the three MAMs have been placed in the custody of the BTIF for further exploitation.

Zone:null
Placename:ISAF#09-1710
Outcome:Ineffective

On 16 SEP 2009, at approx 0710, TF Steel was notified via OCCP that ABP at BCP 3, IVO WB 94752 70405, interdicted a vehicle crossing the border from Pakistan. The evening prior, the ABP at BCP 3 had been in a small firefight with ""Al Qaeda"", who fled, leaving the vehicle in the wadi. Upon daylight, the ABP went to inspect the vehicle and discovered approx. 2500lbs of explosives (4x containers of 500lbs UBE each, and 1x 500lb General Purpose bomb), and 1x suicide vest.

The truck was identified as a VBIED, and KPF was notified, along with the OCCP. KPF responded and was establishing the cordon around the vehicle when the ABP ETT with additional ABP forces arrived on scene. The ETT was redirected from their Bori Tana mission.

1/A/425 (SAPPER 16) responded from COP Gorbuz. Sapper moved to FOB Salerno to pick up EOD with the follow on mission to BCP 3.

As Sapper was arriving on the scene with EOD, the KPF had the vehicle cordoned and would not allow anyone to approach. They had already begun clearing out the explosives and preparing for their disposal. 

Shortly after Sappers' arrival, KPF conducted a controlled detonation of the 4x containers of UBE and the 500lb bomb. The suicide vest was taken back to KPF HQ at FOB Chapman.

As ETT was securing the site, ABP in conjunction with the ETT stopped two vehicles (a van followed by a station wagon) coming across the border. The lead vehicle had only a driver, while the trail vehicle had a driver and passenger. 

Upon investigation, 29x brand new AK-47s and 2x Chest Racks were found in the trail vehicle. Through tactical questioning, it was determined the two vehicles were traveling together.

ABP and ETT detained the individuals and secured the weapons. All items were brought back to SAL for further processing by the Law Enforcement Personnel. The detainees were taken to the detention facility on FOB Salerno.

Commander's Assessment
The ABP interdiction of these two vehicles is a huge success for ANSF in Khowst. No doubt the capture of the 29x AK-47s will be a hindrance to AAF operations. Countless lives were saved by the AAFs capture of the VBIED.to AAF operations.

We received a report yesterday that the entire police force had quit, so we are encouraging GEN Mula Khel to come up with a long term plan to fix this problem. Currently, the QRF from Sharana is covering down in Mata Khan.  GEN Mula Khel also informed us today that an ANP patrol IVO Yaya Khel noticed insurgents we planning/setting up an ambush for them.  GEN Mula Khel sent an ANP QRF from Sharan to assist this patrol.  Early BDA reported were two insurgents detained (Currently enroute to Sharana), various types of weapons, and ammunition.  No report of ANP injured or killed.

The IED was in a box strapped to a bicycle. ANP cordoned off area, and requested EOD support. The PRT coordinated EOD request with TF Eagle.  TF Eagle stood up a patrol to respond, and at 1130Z requested additional EOD assistance from FOB Orgun-E.  At 1200Z, an ANA element investigated and believed they had initially made a mistake and that there was no IED in the basket. They called the PRT and told them they no longer needed assistance. After canceling the EOD request the ANA discovered there actually was an IED hidden deeper in the basket. The ANA were hesitant to use the radio to call back to Sharana because they thought the radio signal might set the IED off. The ANA disarmed the device and recovered it back to an NDS station. A patrol from TF Eagle went to the NDS station and took pictures of the device. The device was a silver container which contained gunpowder w/ 2 remote control devices. Pictures will be sent back to CEXC for further exploitation. NFTR.

Mission complete:  The patrol linked up with the ASG shortly after the firefight with the insurgents.  The IED was struck at 0900z and the MEDEVAC bird came in about an hour.  Charlie Company established a blocking position to the west at the village of Lamcashel while the ASG established OPs covering possible exfil routes to the North, South, and East.  Once the high ground was secured the ANA searched the village of Mamadi while US forces established the cordon for each compound.  The ANA Commander detained two locals.  At nightfall, the US and ASG established an LPOP East of BL42, while the ANA and ETT established an LPOP West of BL42. At 0030z Apache6 confirmed that vehicle A22 was unrecoverable.  At 0200z Charlie Company linked up with Apache and moved to the SW side of RTE Corvette.  A36 established a blocking position at the Northern entrance to RTE Corvette.  Once CAT6 established a TAC VIC BL42, Apache6 and Tillman ANA dismounted and cleared moving N/NE, up the East side of Corvette paralleling Comanche6 who moved up the West side of RTE Corvette.  Only the fighting positions were found during the clearing of the area.  The patrol along with A36, CAT 6, and C6 RTBed and entered the wire at 0945z.  Using a FO position on hilltop 1914, recommend preparatory fires on the EN SBF position prior to ASG clearing RTE Corvette.

Suspected IED cell members detained in Khowst


BAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan  Afghan and Coalition forces detained two adult males after a raid on a compound in the Mandozai district of the Khowst Province early this morning.
	Credible evidence led the forces to the detainees, who are suspected operatives in the Haqqani network, responsible for facilitating IED attacks on peaceful Afghans and Coalition forces in the Khowst Province.
IEDs kill indiscriminately, said Army Maj. Christopher Belcher, a Combined Joint Task Force-82 spokesperson.  The more we can find and the more criminals we can detain, who make these devices, the safer we can make the Afghan roadways.
	No shots were fired, and no one was injured during the operation.

The following debrief is from the FOB Chapman Daily Security Meeting held on 07 May 2008, ANP was not present during the meeting:

KPF

KPF reported that this morning at approximately 07:25 a KPF solider was shot dead on the way to work.  The soldier was identified as Habib ((SHAH)) s/o Mohamed ((HASAN)).  The solider and his cousin were killed when a white station wagon drove up to them near the Shamal Bridge and began shooting.  Eye witnesses (small boys in the area) advised the ANP of their description and they were subsequently able to locate the suspects and apprehend them.  They are currently in custody at the Gurbaz District Center.

KPF then reported that yesterday that a KPF patrol was ambushed while on the way to BCP 10, near Mirsapir, Spera District.  Unfortunately, a KPF solider was killed in the exchange.  The solider was identified as Kamil ((KHAN)) s/o Jahan ((SHAH)); the body was turned over to family members this morning.

ANP

ANP representative was not present this morning, probably due to the shooting this morning at the Shamal Bridge.

Another group of 20-30 ACM was reported to be located at the Asar Khel Madrassa which is located in the Spera District.  The commander is identified as Talib ((NOOR ZAMAN)).  The HQN commander in this area is assessed to be Zangin ((ZADRAN)).  

 

NDS also advised that 40 more ACM fighters are located at Shinkai Mountain, in the Shamal District.  Source stated he observed these fighters while cutting fire wood in the area.  An unidentified individual approached source and advised him to stop what he was doing and move on, and asked that he not reveal what he saw here.

Helmand operation targeted Taliban militants
 
KABUL, Afghanistan  Coalition forces conducting an operation early Saturday killed one militant and detained two others at a compound in Helmand province.    

The forces advanced on the compound and took fire from inside.  They returned fire, killing one militant.  The others surrendered and were not harmed.

 A search of the compound revealed a cache of several rocket-propelled grenades, pressure plates and other IED-making materials.

The weapons cache was removed to a safe distance and destroyed in place.

Credible information led the combined force to the compound in connection with Taliban activity. 

No civilians or coalition forces were injured in the operation.

Helmand operation targets Taliban
 
KABUL, Afghanistan  Afghan and Coalition forces detained two militants in an operation early Wednesday against Taliban forces in the Kajaki district of Helmand Province.  
Militants fired on the combined forces as they approached one of the buildings.  Coalition forces responded with small arms fire and followed up with an air strike that destroyed the militants firing position.    
Credible intelligence led the forces to the compound suspected of housing Taliban militants.
A precision strike was conducted when it was obvious the militants were well-armed and had no intentions of surrendering, said coalition spokesman Maj. Chris Belcher.
The detainees will be questioned as to their identities and involvement in militant Taliban activities.

UPDATE: At 270620ZDEC07, TF ROCK elements located 550m SW of COP VIMOTO (42S XD 7442 6238) conducting a mounted patrol, struck an IED IVO grid 42S XD 74091 61994. The blast resulted in one vehicle destroyed, and three U.S. wounded. After crater analysis, TF ROCK elements determined that the crater was five to six feet in diameter and approximately two feet deep. Later, TF ROCK elements found a second IED in the road near the cemetery IVO grid 42S XD 7430 6179. Additionally, TF ROCK elements found four D-cell batteries and wires leading to a brown box on the side of the road IVO grid 42S XD 74081 61996. Reporting from Sham Shir Khan (SSK) after the IED indicated that Bashar and Haji Matin were responsible for the IED. SSK reported that Haji Matin was in Landigal and Bashar was located in Darbart. The ANA attached to TF ROCK detained Fazal Malik and Omar Gul/Machmod Baz (individual gave both names) immediately after the IED and both tested positive for GSR. Further evaluation will be done on the detainees to determine their participation. NFI. (TF ROCK) 

TF ROCK ANALYST COMMENT: There was no SAF associated with this IED. IEDs have increased in frequency in the southern Korengal Valley in the last month, this making the fourth IED in the last 30 days. Bashar is the IED cell leader who continues to operate in the area and interdict CF both mounted and dismounted. EOD was dispatched to the site IOT conduct further exploitation of the area, but have not submitted a complete report at this time.

UPDATE: On 28 December 2007 at 0953Z, BATTLE 26 patrolled to Loi Kalay when a boy whistled as in to signal someone. The ANA search the house at 42SXD73786182 where the boy was located and found nothing significant. The patrol continued north to northern Loi Kalay where WC1 heard an explosion earlier. The patrol reached the house at grid 42SXD7390661972 and ANA searched the house and found 4xMOD-5 devises in a storage room. This prompted a more thorough search and found 5 more MOD-5 devices and various wires all around the lower level of the house. When the search concluded the patrol found in total: 9xMOD-5 devices, various wires, dismantled radios, $54,500 Afghani, and 2 electronic doorbells. After the search was over the ANA went to find Sham Shir Khan who reported he had no idea what they were and clamed that they are common things.
TF ROCK ANALYST COMMENTS:  The house was located 200m west of the IED yesterday and likely the house where the past 3 IEDs were assembled from.  Prior to searching the house, BATTLE reported hearing an explosion in the same area as the house and WILDCAT observed what appeared to be one PAX pulling security on the house.  Shadow was on station and monitored the house.  No movement was observed in IR or EO camera views.  Due to the proximity of the house in relation to the IED strike and line of sight from the house to the strike site, the captured ACM likely used this as the command and control area.  The house would also provide insurgents with a covered area to filmed the attack.  This is an excellent capture for CF in the Korengal Valley as it continues to search and destroy the IED cell in the valley.  With the death of Juma Khan and seizures of IED parts and materials it is continuing to destroy the ACM activates and continuing to make it harder for ACM to rebuild and reorganize their operations in the valley. While searching the houses BATTLE received ICOM traffic 189 degrees, Freq 143.25 ""we see them what should we do, they are embarrassing us by searching the houses"".  This statement is showing the local population are observing CF defeating them and the ACM may be slowly losing faith with the local population.  This could also indicate there are issues in the area and as we seize their caches and weapons, the commanders observing will not be happy and may replace or stop funding the commanders in charge there.

As a result, RCP 7 diverted from their scheduled route and responded to the reported location, which was approximately 1km north of the S-turn near Yaqubi.  Unable to locate the ODAs source, elements of the RCP initiated a search of multiple vehicles and detained two individuals that tested positive for TNT and Nitro.  Based on the test results, the RCP notified ANP, which took custody of the suspects.  After the suspects were apprehended, RCP 7 was diverted to another location, a frequently used bypass that circumvents the construction on Route Torch, to link up with the ODA source.  The source pointed out three possible IED locations.  For safety purposes, the Husky drove over the suspect locations, but failed to identify any metallic signatures.  In order to ensure no IEDs were emplaced, the Buffalo was used to excavate the area.  The first location resulted in the discovery of a piece of yellow wire that was buried from the east side to the center of the road, but was not hooked to any other components.  Close inspection of the wire revealed that its contacts were still clean.  Thus, the Team Leader assessed that the wire was recently emplaced.

These two individuals are from the Babakarkhil tribe and from the village of Badi Khel.  These two individuals were tested with the EX-spray kit and both tested positive for TNT and Nitro.  ANP from Khowst took custody of them and brought them back to ANP headquarters.

While conducting route clearance, RCP 7 received guidance from TF Professional TOC, 2-321 FA, that an OGA source had witnessed 5-8 ACM emplacing IEDs along Route Torch.  As a result, RCP 7 diverted from their scheduled route and responded to the reported location, which was approximately 1km north of the S-turn near Yaqubi.  Unable to locate the OGAs source, elements of the RCP initiated a search of multiple vehicles and detained two individuals that tested positive for TNT and Nitro.  Based on the test results, the RCP notified ANP, which took custody of the suspects. After the suspects were apprehended, RCP 7 was diverted to another location, a frequently used bypass that circumvents the construction on Route Torch, to link up with the ODA source.  The source pointed out three possible IED locations.  For safety purposes, the Husky drove over the suspect locations, but failed to identify any metallic signatures.  In order to ensure no IEDs were emplaced, the Buffalo was used to excavate the area.  The first location resulted in the discovery of a piece of yellow wire that was buried from the east side to the center of the road, but was not hooked to any other components.  Close inspection of the wire revealed that its contacts were still clean.  Thus, the Team Leader assessed that the wire was recently emplaced.  This was the only IED component found at the three dig sites.  Questioning of the Local Nationals by RCP 7s interpreter and KPF Soldiers revealed that their houses had been searched by Afghan citizens, believed to be members of the Taliban, earlier in the day.

UPDATE: TFK C-IED FIRST LOOK REPORT attached. 
Summary: At 31 1022D*Aug 09, a CF Engineer team was installing a culvert grate on culvert #1, on RTE BROWN. The security elements were approached by children who wanted them to follow. The soldiers remained at their station and shortly after there was a large explosion, approx 80m to their SOUTH, around the bend in the mud wall. No one was injured. The area was cordoned off and searched. Three FAM were picked up nearby and released. Two FAM were found in a nearby grape hut. One tested positive for GSR and EXR. They were detained and sent up the custody chain. At approx 1049D* QRF along with CIED arrived on scene to conduct a post blast investigation. A large crater containing steel shell fragments ( poss 155mm artillery round) was found at GR 41R QQ 29719 88231. CIED searched the grape hut and found a possible firng point, (FP) at GR 41R QQ 29752 88272. The FP was well positioned, with good visibility and an exit route under tree cover. The INS could have thrown the transmitter into the stream or nearby tall grass. The area was searched but no transmitter was found. It is suspected that the target was CF Engineers. The suspected RCIED location was chosen because the INS saw the engineers measuring the culvert the week before and knew they would arrive soon to work on it. There were two other IED's found in the general area during the week following the measurements. The INS would not have any problem installing IED's in that location due to the good natural cover. The small children were probably used as a come on to draw the soldiers into the kill zone. There could be a repeat of this attack when the Engineer start working on culvert # 3. It is recommended that a thorough search of the area (100m min) be conducted before the work commences. QRF and C-IED left the scene at 1315D* and arrived at FOB MSG at 1355D*",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,TFK / TF South JOC Watch,2R22R BG,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,41RQQ2971988231,31.50613022,65.41883087,TF South JOC Watch,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

B COY 2 YORKS WITH 3/3/205 KDK reported that while conducting a joint patrol, FF suffered an IED strike resulting in 2 x ANA KIA, 3 x ANA WIA(1 x CAT A, 2 x CAT B). The explosion left a large crafter, and hit the second vehicle destroying the rear of the vehicle. FF cordoned the area and MEDEVAC the casualties IAW MM(S) 11-22F and 11-22J to BSN R3.

CONSOLIDATED SITEREP 221204Z
It is the opinion of C/S AMBER 33A that this could have been a VOIED(PP), however there is a possibility that it could have been RC by the fact that it was the second vehicle in the packet and the rear of the vehicle took majority of the force of the explosion. The explosion left a crater approximately 4 foot wide by 4 foot deep. 
Immediately after the explosion C/S AMBER 33A led a patrol to the site of the explosion and pushed onto the high ground to the East of the explosion into a blocking position with the ANA to the North and the West into blocking position. A VCP was established on the road to the South, the ANA casualties had been taken to MSQ DC before any FF arrived at the scene. C/S AMBER 33A then kept the block in place while the vehicle was recovered by ANA troops back to PB Talibjan. Whilst the recovery was in progress, ANA troops conducted a sweep of the area and cleared all debris, this was then put in a pile and covered in rocks as a memorial (NOTE - The memorial is not a marker of any kind but a memorial to the ANA troops involved in the incident). During the incident, the ANA arrested 2 x LN males that were seen running away after the explosion who were taken to MSQ DC. After the sweep was complete, AMBER 33A then extracted back to PB Talibjan. It is the assessment of C/S AMBER 33A that there needs to be a CP to cover the vulnerable point and hte area surrounding it.

Suspected suicide bomb facilitator detained in Khowst

BAGRAM AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN  Afghan and Coalition forces detained one adult male after a raid on a house in the Tani district of the Khowst Province early this morning.

A search of the building turned up AK-47s and military-style load-bearing vests.  

Credible evidence led the forces to the detainee, a suspected operative in the Haqqani network, who is also suspected of facilitating suicide bombers in the Khowst Province.

Facilitators like this are simply cowards, exploiting impressionable people for their own purposes, said Maj. Christopher Belcher, a Combined Joint Task Force-82 spokesman.  

No shots were fired, and no one was injured during the operation.

Militant facilitator captured in Khowst
 
KABUL, Afghanistan  Afghan and Coalition forces conducted an operation early Sunday, detaining an adult male at a compound in Khowst province.    

The combined force took one adult male into custody after discovering two AK-47s and a pistol.  

Intelligence reports indicated the detainee was attempting to facilitate a plan involving militants posing as Afghan National Army soldiers in order to attack coalition forces and officials of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 

Its obvious how desperate these extremists have become, said Coalition spokesman, Maj. Chris Belcher.  Theyve taken to impersonating legitimate officials to conduct their vicious attacks.

The inhabitants of the compound complied with a request for peaceful surrender, and were not harmed.

No shots were fired and there were no injuries reported as a result of the operation.

Afghan Border Police detain Nangarhar province Taliban leader     

BAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan - Afghan Border Police, advised by Coalition forces, detained a Taliban leader in the Pachir Wa Agam district of Nangarhar province during an operation May 24. 
After receiving information on the whereabouts of Sayed Gulab, a notorious Nangarhar Taliban area commander and improvised explosive device cell facilitator, ABP members quickly moved to the village of Shir Wagan and detained him.  Gulab is currently being held for questioning in a Coalition detention facility.
No Afghan civilians or ABP members were injured during the successful operation.    
Gulab has been responsible for emplacing IEDs in the Pachir Wa Agam district resulting in the injuries and deaths of innocent Afghan civilians and Afghan National Security Forces.  He is also known to have extensive connections with other senior Taliban and Al Qaeda leadership in Nangarhar and Pakistan.   
	The detention of Sayed Gulab will lead to information on Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders; including their operations within Nangarhar and neighboring provinces, said Army Maj. Chris Belcher, a Combined Joint Task Force- 82 spokesperson.  The enemies of Afghanistan may run but can not hide from Afghan National Security and Coalition forces.

At 202045JUN07 elements of TM Battle began infil into sector IOT isolate Landigal, OBJ Viper, for CFand their search for caches in the town.
Immediately, B6 noticed that the ACM in the area were unaware of the companys movement into sector.  Not until first light around 0010Z did any chatter come out about their positions.  Believe the low illum and the movement of elements phased throughout the night into different locations allowed Battle to move undetected under the cover of darkness and surprise the enemy.
Early in the morning at around 0028Z and 0045Z we began to get reports from ACM that they had seen us moving towards Landigal and needed to get into position.   They were going to use a lot of rounds as well.   The elders were mad that we had shut down the road ISO the operation to allow FOM for the QRF to and from the KOP.   
B/W 0100Z and 0300Z ACM leaders were frantic about trying to locate U.S. forces noticing Battle elements in the low and high ground. They took over everywhere. They are on ROHANEE&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s side, they are on top of the hill, they are everywhere. They are blocking the 4 corners there, they are even behind GOOD&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s house.   At 0130Z Bashar was speaking about getting ready to attack the hill.   LLVI picked that LOB up over Aliabad and Wildcat 1 PIDd a man amongst five others talking on an ICOM at the same time.  
Immediately Battle 6 called for confirmation to engage said target w/ ICOM and Rock 6 approved.   Throughout the morning LLVI picked up several transmission talking about setting in ambushes to attack and to shoot a lot of bullets at ISAF.  Wildcat 1 from HT 1705 continued to observed target and to allow further intel to develop until the exfil.  Battle 6 was worried if they engaged before CF had reached Landigal it would start a fight.   Battle 6 wanted to complete the mission if possible before engaging.  
During the clearance of OBJ Viper, CF found fuses in one of the cache sites that could be linked to IEDs.  They noticed there were no military age males in the village as well.  This B6 attributes to the late start and arriving at Landigal during daylight.  On the infil several soldiers sprained ankles due to the terrain and is why B6 left B36 at the mouth of the draw to secure said soldiers.   B26 pushed to isolate the southern portion of Viper, and B6 used IDF and shadow to cover the northern portion because B26 couldnt make it.
On exfil 2x Mirages were used to conduct a show of force IOT deter any ACM attack.   This was where B6 thought the ICOM chatter would come to life.   On exfil the target in Alia Bad was talking to a teenager, and B6 gave the order to shoot as soon as the teen was away.   As the teen stood up the target began walking and this is when WC1 engaged with SR 25, M-24, and the Barrett.  The target fell behind a shack.   Immediately afterwards B36 moved to secure the area while CF conducted SSE.  They were unable to find any blood trail, but found the teen and a brand new uniform in the building the target was in previously.

               Huge crowd gathered and watched. Asked a lot of questions. Attempted to engage subject in conversation . Wanted to know why subject was being stopped.  Crowd made no threatening gestures and kept a neutral attitude.

T.	MISSION NARRATIVE:

	While on mounted patrol, returning from Cagny and Lacey drop off at ANP in Mehtar Lam, I observed the subject Azartullah squatting down on South side of the road at grid (above).  Azartullah had a note pad in hand and appeared to be observing the vehicles in the convoy closely.  I had the driver stop the truck and radioed my intent to field interview the subject to the convoy commander. Upon exiting my truck Azartullah got up and started to walk East down the street. I verbally advised him to stop and motioned him to me.  He complied.  When he was interviewed, Azartullah appeared very nervous and was mumbling and visibly shaking.  He spoke constantly and in a nervous and evasive manner.  I asked him where he was from and Subject said he lived in Alingar.  I asked him why he was in Mehtar Lam and he said he was trying to call a friend to pick him up and go to Jalalabad.  I asked him for the notebook and had an ANP officer search him.  In Azartullahs pockets was another notebook (Azartullah said it belonged to his friend), an Afghan birth certificate ID with his picture on it, a business card with phone numbers and a name written on it belonging to Sher Agha.  I continued to ask him where his friend was and Azartullah said he was trying to call his friend. It should be noted that S1 had no phone on his person at the time of the stop.  S1 further advised he worked at a factory in Jalalabad with his friend. I asked where his friend lived and he said somewhere here.  Azartullah continued to engage in spontaneous conversation and advised that he has been hassled by Mujahadeen, and Taliban, but this is the first time U.S. forces stopped him.  I like the Afghan government and want to see it do well.  I asked him to help us identify Taliban in the area and show us the bad guys that gave him a problem.  He said, They are in Pakistan.  I dont know what they look like.  Azartullahs story was constantly changed, he continued to act very nervous, and was vague in his answers the entire time I spoke with him.  At this point, I conferred with the convoy commander and we felt he was being way too evasive and his story was inconsistent and changed too much.  We radioed the TOC and provided a SITREP.  TOC advised  us to hold Azartullah until NDS agents arrived.  After about a 30 minute wait three NDS agents arrived and took Azartullah into custody.  We RTBed to the FOB and debriefed were debriefed by the S-2.
                  
RECOMMENDATIONS: 

Re-stated SOP for disposition of field interviewed/detained personnel. vWaiting out there in the middle of the road for ~30 minutes while a very large crowd gathered became a potentially unsafe situation.

Kabul, 3 July: Mohamad Rahim, an Afghan national who allegedly worked as an interpreter and spokesman for Al-Qa&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;idah chief Bin Ladin, has reportedly been arrested by Pakistani security officials.
Mollah Abid, introducing himself as a Taleban loyalist, told Pajhwok Afghan News on Tuesday [3 July] that Rahim had earlier gone missing in Punjab&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s capital Lahore.
But it is presumed he was apprehended by Pakistani law-enforcement staff.
A resident of Chaparhar District of the eastern Nangarhar Province, Rahim had reportedly worked as a translator for the multibillionaire Saudi dissident, the main figure on the US wanted list.
Speaking from an undisclosed location, Mollah Abid said Rahim, suffering from a stomach ailment, had gone to Pakistan for treatment.
A former Hezb-e Eslami commander currently living in Lahore confirmed that Rahim had disappeared in the eastern city.

They stated they did not know where the enemy came from or stay.  Reg. 4-3 then decided to conduct a patrol to the area where the Jingle Trucks were taken and burned.  While enroute, Reg. 4-3 witnessed a motorcycle with 2 riders turn and drive away at a high rate of speed.  Reg. 4-3 gave chase until the motorcycle went into a village at grid VB9133 8571.  Reg. 4-3 spoke to local Nationals who stated they were the only family with a motorcycle in the village.  Reg. 4-3 noticed a motorcycle in a Qualot and decided to search the area.  Reg. 4-3 was informed by the local in the Qualot the rider had ran back to their compound to get the registration.  He stated they were afraid since there is a local regulation that states motorcycles can only have one rider and they had two riders.  While speaking to locals outside, Reg. 4-3 noticed a man sitting on a wall dressed all in black giving hand signals to the locals.  Reg. 4-3 had the man brought to the vehicles and began to question him.  The man stated he was from Pakistan and was visiting his brother and working for him for the last 2 years.  He stated he was a tractor driver and when asked where his tractor was, he stated I have not driven in 1 year.  The man was very nervous and was sending hand signals to the locals.  Reg. 4-3 spoke to his brother and the bother stated his brother had only been there for a couple of days.  Reg. 4-3 told the ANP we would transport the man to the DC for further questioning and the ANP agreed.  Upon reaching the District Center, the Jingle Truck driver who was attacked identified the man as one of his attackers.  NDS was at the District Center and took the man in their custody and then transported him to Sharan.  Reg. 4-3 then waited to offer assistance to the Jingle Truck Driver in recovering their burned Jingle truck, however the recovery truck did not arrive.

Analysis: This IED was located along RTE Virginia in the same vicinity as a previous IED attack that occurred on 10 NOV 07.  IED activity in this area has recently increased with a total of five IED related incidents within the past three days.  This is an indication ACM have replaced the former IED cell leader, Mullah Qadim.  Recent HUMINT reporting indicates Pir Mohommad is the likely replacement for Qadim.  The village of Heybat Khel lies approximately 4 km to the SW, which is a suspected ACM safe haven.  ACM IED cells in this region are assessed to emplace PPIEDs along routes that lead to support areas.  ACM have also been known to pre-seed IEDs that only require the power supply to be connected to be armed.  ACM were likely observing RCP 7s movement and armed the IED accordingly.

Team Leader assessed the main charge to be 1ea - Landmine, AT (model unknown) based on blast seat dimensions.  Recovered components were cleared, and turned over to embedded CEXC element - SAL CIED for exploitation. 	

Historical Comparisons:  
(F) PPIEDs are commonly used throughout this area. 
(F) Power source, pressure plate and main charge were all in a line, perpendicular to the road.
(F) The IED was approximately 150m from the PPIED the Buffalo struck the day before - 720-TM7-022-08\2007NOV10\10:45(L)\42S WC 04921 12970\POST BLAST.	
Lesson Learned:
(F) The power source was found off of the route, several feet from the pressure plate.
(O) INS forces may be placing the power source off of the route in an attempt to prevent detection.

As SHAFIQ boarded the ANA bus wearing civilian clothes with a concealed suicide vest containing explosives, he was confronted by an unidentified ANA soldier at the door.  At this time, SHAFIQ tried to detonate the suicide vest using a detonator switch in his hand.  The ANA soldier realized SHAFIQ was a suicide bomber and kicked SHAFIQ in the chest forcing him from the doorway of the bus onto the curb.  SHAFIQ was then confronted by two Afghan civilian pedestrians in close proximity to the bus stop.  The pedestrians struggled with SHAFIQ grabbing his arms in an effort to prevent him from detonating the suicide vest.  Subsequently, an Afghan National Police Officer in the vicinity of the incident arrived at the scene and arrested SHAFIQ.  SHAFIQ was immediately transported to the Kabul City Police Department with the suicide vest.  At this time, it is uncertain if the suicide vest failed upon detonation or if SHAFIQ was unable to detonate the suicide vest due to the efforts of the ANA soldier and the two pedestrians. 

 The FBI was notified of the incident and arrived at the Kabul City Police Department at approximately 0940L.  Upon arriving at the scene, the suicide vest was observed on the lawn in the front courtyard area.  An FBI Bomb Technician assessed the suicide vest and determined it had not been rendered safe.  French Bomb Technicians assigned to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were notified and responded to the scene.  Upon arriving at the scene, a French Bomb Technician rendered the suicide vest safe.  Upon being rendered safe, the suicide vest was photographed, however officials from the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior (MOI) insisted on retaining custody of the vest.
 
 Subsequently, FBI agents were allowed to fingerprint, photograph and take DNA samples from SHAFIQ.   MOI officials also allowed FBI agents a short interview of SHAFIQ.  SHAFIQ was further identified as being the son of MOHAMMAD TAHER.  SHAFIQ indicated he is from the City of Sader of Peshawer, Pakistan.  SHAFIQ claimed he was drugged by unknown individuals who forcibly placed the vest on him.  These unknown individuals then drove SHAFIQ to the vicinity of the ANA bus stop and dropped him off.  SHAFIQ refused to provide any further details.  At this time, SHAFIQ will remain in Ministry of Interior custody, however SHAFIQ may be made available to the FBI in the future for a more in depth interview.

The detainee is a female who was wearing a burkha with the vest underneath.  The detainee was most likely acting as a transportation means for the suicide vest, as the batteries for the vest were not installed in the vest but were carried in a separate pouch.  The vest was laden with C4, however did not have any ball bearing or any other shrapnel, again lending to the assessment that the detainee was only transporting the vest.

(S) TF Bayonet Comment: This suicide vest can likely be associated with TB facilitator Noor Mohamad who was reported to have facilitated the travel of 2 suicide bombers from PAK into Nangarhar and later into Jalalabad. The suicide bombers are planning to attack the Jalalabad Airfield. In addition an unidentified individual has been reportedly to be traveling along with the suicide bombers. The individual is reported to be bringing additional funds as well as explosives for the TB within the region. Noor Alam was allegedly responsible to receive the explosives which consisted of suicide vests that resembled ANA vests. In mid-October reporting indicates that the vests were brought into Noor Alams house by Nazo, Nazos wife, and Aziz. Noor Alam was waiting for the arrival of the suicide bombers in order to transport the suicide vests into Jalalabad in preparation for the possible attack. Past reporting supports that insurgents use females to transport explosives because ABP soldiers avoid searching females. Noor Alam is identified to be from the Shewa area, located in Kuz Konar. This suicide vest was recovered in Kuz Kunar District and then brought to the NDS in Jalalabad city.

TF Paladin arrived at the scene at 1445Z, and upon questioning of NDS personnel learned that a NDS source reported a woman was wearing a possible suicide vest.  AT 1200Z, an elderly woman 50 to 60 years of age was apprehended by Jalalabad NDS officers, at the Kuz Kuner Bus Station.  The woman was on foot and wearing traditional clothing.  After apprehension the woman was searched and was found to be wearing a suicide vest, after questioning it was reported that the elderly woman name was (Hasan Tari).  During questioning of the suspect she stated that she was only transporting the vest to its intended user in Jalalabad, whose name she did not give. The NDA took possession of the vest and notified EOD 

Upon arrival of the site EOD rendered the device safe. It appeared that while wearing the vest the suspect did not have a power source connected to the vest. The batteries were in a separate case in her pocket making the vest safe for transport. EOD took control of the explosives and trigger device. The vest was given to the NDS Officer (Hay Dar) for evidence in the prosecution of the suspect.  NDS personnel also took video and pictures of explosives and components of the vest. NFTR.

While conducting RCP ISO OP MATOON, traveling South on Route Torch IVO the Kholbesat Wadi, the Husky detected and marked a metallic object in the road.  Noticing what appeared to be marking stones, the Buffalo was called forward.  Buffalo uncovered the main charge with the excavation arm and remotely separated the power source. EOD TM Leader confirmed component separation and cleared the area of any possible secondary IEDs.  The power source and clothes pin were discovered on the east side of Route Torch with an insulator in the clothes pin (tripwire had not been attached).  On the west side of Route Torch, the trip wire was wrapped around a small stone with the positive block (plastic insert) attached to the running end of the trip line.  The trip line had not been strung out across the route.  The IED was not in an armed and functioning condition.  The road surface was hard packed indicating the main charge had been there for an extended period of time.  IED consisted of 1ea  British Landmine, AT Model MK 7/1 (Main Charge); 1ea  Clothes Pin; and 1ea  Power Source (w/ 6ea  D Cell Batteries in plastic tray, wrapped in tape).  RCP dismounted security element discovered several suspicious items and called the EOD team to investigate.  Items were in burlap sacks partially buried in a smaller wadi to the East of Route Torch.  The first sack recovered contained 24ea - RPG expelling motors, and 28ea - Chinese Fuze, Mortar, PD, Model M6.  The second sack recovered contained 134ea - Russian Fuze, Projectile, PDSD, Model MG37, and 1ea  Chinese Fuze, Rocket, PD, Model MJ-1.  Main charge was disposed of on site by detonation; remaining ordnance was transported to a SHA.  Non-hazardous IED components were turned in to SAL C-IED CEXC element.

INVESTIGATOR&apos;&apos;S COMMENTS (CEXC)
a. (S//REL) Limited CF activity has occurred North of the 11 Grid Line before OP DEADWOOD and MATOON was executed, therefore IED incidents in the north western part of Jaberi Province area have been minimal. The components recovered from this incident and method of operation is similar to CEXC Profile 2.1.3.2.2 and specific incidents outlined 
CEXC/AFG/677/07, 745, 748, 794, 797, 826, 935, 1139, 1144 and 1145 reports refer. In this particular event, the components were found emplaced but in an unarmed state. Marking stones on the side of the road to identify the IED location is a common pattern for insurgents.
b. (S//REL) It is likely insurgents pre- emplaced the IED and other items in the wadi area in
anticipation of CF and ANSF elements moving into the area, however were likely blocked from
approaching the wadi by the presence of CF elements the day the IED was discovered by RCP.
The additional ordnance recovered in close proximity to the IED was a cache location and
possibly an ambush site. There is no conclusive evidence or recent insurgent patterns of that
area to confirm the ambush site possibility.

(S//REL) On Monday, November 19, 2007 at approximately 0630L hours, MOHAMMAD SHAFIQ (hereafter SHAFIQ), a citizen of Pakistan, approximately 20 years old, attempted to board an Afghan National Army (ANA)  bus at a designated bus stop located within Zone 8, Kabul City, Kabul Province Afghanistan.  As SHAFIQ boarded the ANA bus wearing civilian clothes with a concealed suicide vest containing explosives, he was confronted by an unidentified ANA soldier at the door.  At this time, SHAFIQ tried to detonate the IED using a detonator switch in his hand.  The ANA soldier realized SHAFIQ was a suicide bomber and kicked SHAFIQ in the chest forcing him from the doorway of the bus onto the curb.  SHAFIQ was then confronted by two Afghan civilian pedestrians in close proximity to the bus stop.  The pedestrians struggled with SHAFIQ grabbing his arms in an effort to prevent him from detonating the device. Subsequently, an Afghan National Police Officer in the vicinity of the incident arrived at the scene and arrested SHAFIQ.  SHAFIQ was immediately transported to the Kabul City Police Department with the IED. At this time, it is uncertain if the IED failed to function properly or if SHAFIQ was unable to detonate it due to the efforts of the ANA soldier and the two pedestrians. 

b. (S//REL) CEXC was notified of the incident and arrived at the Kabul City Police Department at approximately 0940L hours.  Upon arriving at the scene, the IED was observed on the lawn in the front courtyard area.  An FBI Bomb Technician assessed the device and determined it had not been rendered safe.  French Bomb Technicians assigned to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were notified and responded to the scene.  Upon arriving at the scene, a French Bomb Technician rendered the device safe.  Upon being rendered safe, the IED was photographed, however officials from the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior (MOI) insisted on retaining custody of the vest.

c. (S//REL) Subsequently, FBI agents were allowed to fingerprint, photograph and take DNA samples from SHAFIQ.   MOI officials also allowed FBI agents a short interview of SHAFIQ.  SHAFIQ was further identified as being the son of MOHAMMAD TAHER.  SHAFIQ indicated he is from the City of Sader of Peshawer, Pakistan.  SHAFIQ claimed he was drugged by unknown individuals who forcibly placed the vest on him.  These unknown individuals then drove SHAFIQ to the vicinity of the ANA bus stop and dropped him off.  SHAFIQ refused to provide any further details.  At this time, SHAFIQ will remain in Ministry of Interior custody, however SHAFIQ may be made available to the FBI in the future for a more in depth interview.

All JM elements conducted Operation Talidega , with the French and ANA ,the mission was to allow ANA to search and clear designated compounds looking for specific targets.  During JM32C search of compound a suspected Taliban member was detained by the ANA 3rd Company Commander.  A computer was found in his presences, and during a later search we recovered a aiming site for a mortar tube and an Icom radio.
3rd company ANA was to clear a predestinated compounds then provide a blocking position to the south to cover 1st companies ANA which was clearing another compound.  At or around 11:30 Sgt Brock was posted with SGT Robertson and two ANA soldiers on an OP to observe enemy movement and deter a possible ambush.   While finding an OP site Sgt Brock ran across a small group of armed men.  After gaining PID and confirming that they were enemy SGT Robinson and Sgt Brock opened fire.  The group was between 5-7 young males standing at the edge of a field near a large compound in the tree line. They were armed with what looked like AK 47s and were approximately 150 meters away.  Upon receiving fire from the JM element the group scattered and returned sporadic fire at their location.  Sgt Brock then called up JM6 and relayed my grid and distance and azimuth to the location of the enemy and requested a CASS run on the compound.  The JM element then immediately returned to the ANA 3rd Company line to report the activities to the French. 
All JM elements had no further action until exfill.  Upon exfill JM32C was tasked to be the last element to leave the valley holding security for 1st ANA Company. About 500 meters before the wadi while crossing a very large open field JM32c began taking progressively heavy small arms fire.  JM32c the French and one squad of ANA began returning fire.  JM32c had to buddy team bound to the river bed where they found cover.  JM32c then called in to JM6 and requested a fire mission and relayed the situation.  JM32c was able to verify muzzle flashes in the tree line to the immediate rear (east).  Multiple times the SAF was so heavy that we were pinned down and unable to move.  Once JM32c reached the river bed they found cover and returned as much fire as possible.  The rest of the ANA Company had crossed the river and were in the village heading toward the MSR.  JM32c was taking heavy fire and was unable to cross the river until the rest of the JM elements gave suppressive fire on the enemy location.

teams in the area should be exploiting Enemy Caches, UXOs and IEDs. It is a dangerous
TTP to allow non qualified personnel to investigate caches as it allows the INS to target CF by

(S//REL)  Two AH-64s departed FOB Salerno at 2019Z on a QRF call to interdict IED emplacers in Khowst.  TF Glory received SIGINT of IED emplacers digging in the middle of a road.  AWT approached the area covertly and observed 3x AAF digging in the middle of the road at 42S XC 0071 0519.  While observing, 1x AAF moved off to a nearby qalat at 42S XC 0074 0507 and did not come back out.  AWT was cleared to engage remaining personnel by Glory TOC and AWT fired a total of 60x rounds of 30mm, resulting in 2x AAF KIA.  AWT conducted several passes of the area with no further movement and had to RTB due to deteriorating weather.  AWT landed at Salerno at 2106Z. TF NO MERCY S2 Comment: AAF continues to utilize previous IED blast sites to emplace IEDs. These AAF were most likely using this method due to the recent bad weather which made digging easier and did not anticipate any air assets observing their activity.  This area does not typically see IED activity and may have been targeting ANSF as they move to and from Terazayi DC. 
	
(S//REL)  At 70120L Jul 08, Head Hunter Main sent the Sabari ANP to investigate the site where the IED emplacers were engaged and one KIA was found and one LN arrested. Found in the vicinity were also a battery pack with lamp cord attached, a clothes pin with lamp cord attached, two pick axes, a cell phone and a small plastic bag with 8 phone numbers and 7 names associated with the phone numbers.  

ITEMS RECOVERED 
(C//REL)..One eight D cell battery pack, wrapped in black electrical tape, attached is a length of white Dual Core Multi Strand (DCMS) wire.  This wire is approximately 50cm in length.
		
(C//REL )  One grey plastic clothes pin, contacts formed by screw and bolts with one core each of a DCMS wire attached to each arm of the clothes pin, the wires are secured with black electrical tape.  Wire is approximately 40cm long.
		
(C//REL) Small plastic bag containing small pieces of paper with telephone numbers written on them.

Update:  TFK C-IED FIRST LOOK report attached.  Summary from TFK C-IED FIRST LOOK: (S//REL ISAF, OEF) At 26 0830D*Jun 09, The QRF along with CIED from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS) deployed to the site of a probable SIED (SUICED BOMBER) at GR 41R 55101 00675. The NDS had prior knowledge of the attempt and were waiting for the SIED. The SIED arrived by taxi at approx 0800D*, from the PASHMUL district. Upon exiting the taxi he sat down and waited for his target. The NDS commander was behind the SIED, and approached him and shook his hand. Once he had the SIED in his grip he immobilized him with the assistance of other NDS officers, keeping a firm control on the SIED hands. They removed the batteries, blindfolded him and partially handcuffed him to a metal fence. After linking up with the NDS, the QRF and CIED arrived on site. The suicide bomber had one hand cuffed to a fence and two NDS officers were holding the other hand. NDS secured the suicide bomber by cuffing the other hand to the fence, and EOD carefully manually removed the vest. The suicide bomber was then taken to NDS HQ. The suicide bomber was wearing a black vest containing HBE and pieces of rebar intended as shrapnel. The vest had two white, commercial rocker switches taped to his arms (one on each hand). The switches were connected to two 9V batteries (not recovered), and to two commercial electric detonators. The detonators were taped to two det cord loops (one on each side of the vest). When the intended target would have approached the suicide bomber would only have to press the two rocker switches, closing the electrical circuit and setting off the vest, killing the target.

The ANP stopped the patrol and asked for EOD assistance. They had found IED components inside a compound at GR 41R QR 60019 01545. USPMT informed CNS HQ by radio. At approx 1640D*, a QRF and CIED from CNS deployed to the link up point. Upon arrival the ANP HQ DEPUTY CHIEF was giving a press conference on the scene.

A FAM was also detained and taken by the ANP. According to the ANP, the site was under surveillance for over a month, they were awaiting the arrival of key INS from QUETTA CHAMAN and TORIN KOWT. They had no choice to raid the site when it was learned that the components were to be moved. When the ANP searched the compound they found IED components and UBE through out the area. They dug in a corner and found a 45 gal blue plastic barrel containing the weapons, grenades, munitions and detonators. EOD confirmed that all the necessary components for a large SVIED and SIED were on site. CIED kept the DTMFs, documents, x-rays and cassettes.

NDS transported the material to the OCC-P. EOD TL with LEP proceeded to OCC-P and learned that the previous day NDS had been involved in a gun fight with three individuals that were attempting to emplace an IED. They observed a MAM with an AK-47, pulling security for two MAM's trying to set up an IED. They spotted the NDS and a gun fight ensued. During the fight one INS was KIA. A second INS was WIA but fled the scene on a motorcycle. The third INS was detained. After the engagement, NDS personnel approached the site and located one each camera flash and one each homemade spool containing alternator type firing wire. They were not able to locate the IED or any additional components. They then transported the KIA to the OCC-P where fingerprints and two each DNA swabs were collected. The detainee was processed at the OCC-P and is currently in custody. They then carried the evidence with them in order to process it and write their report. It had been handled by multiple individuals bare handed through out the evening. They then brought the evidence to the attention of CF for processing. They want to see if the detainees fingerprints are on the camera flash as he has been detained at multiple IED sites, but no evidence has been located to link him to the cases. They feel the blood stains belong to the WIA, but it may be from the truck bed used to transport the KIA. The LEP thru TERP praised them for a job well done collecting the evidence and stopping the emplacement. He then counseled them on their actions with the evidence after the collection to include contaminating the evidence by handling it bare handed.

***UPDATE*** Summary derived from associated IED report:

After leaving FOB Frontnac with Taliban detainee our RCP came across a Striker unit who found another IED in the same culvert we found and cleared one from earlier in the day, See CIDNE # IED-20090819020141RQR6237721060. IED was detonated in place.
RCP left FOB Frontnac with Taliban detainee in route to KAF. Approx 8 miles south of the FOB RCP was stopped by an USA Striker unit saying they found what they thought to be an IED. The buffalo deployed it's arm to check the left and right side of the culvert for IED's and landmines, none found. RCP element leader ask EOD to clear the culvert. EOD found another IED in the same culvert they cleared earlier that morning (See CIDNE # IED-20090819020141RQR6237721060). Given the earlier incident EOD team leader thought he the team's actions taken against the previously IED had might have been watched and the EF were trying to counter what they thought would happen again. EOD tried to access the IED from the east side of the culvert but the barrier was secured in place and the robot could not remove it or reach the IED through the grate. The IED was located further in the culvert on the west side than the previous one was so removing could not be preformed and BIP action was taken.

ISAF REF# 08-2777 (CLOSED)

UPDATE:  SUMMARY FROM USMC EOD REPORT: AFG-NAW2-060 PBA 

A LN vehicle was traveling a route driven by ISAF vehicles frequently. The vehicle struck an IED with minor wounds being suffered. The blast was caught by Marines on post and QRF was sent out to investigate. EOD was in route with the
Log Pack.

EOD conducted a post blast assessment of the site finding jug fragments. 2 Improvised caps were found on scene. EOD was MC at 1845 and in
friendly lines at 1945.

The improvised caps were collected for exploitation.

The blast seat was constant with 40lbs of explosives. Placement of the
improvised caps suggests they did not come from the IED. Neither was burnt or cracked
which would be expected after being blasted from an IED hole. One was found just outside
of the vehicle that was hit and the other inside the vehicle. The 2nd Improvised Cap
found (see below) is the one which has been seen most frequently by this EOD Team. Once
the caps were found the Guard Force was notified and one individual was detained.

** UPDATE ** Task Force Kandahar Counter IED Tactical Exploitation Report (See Media) Summary from Task Force Kandahar Counter IED Tactical Exploitation Report:At approx 061200D*Sept 09, a CF patrol traveling SOUTHWEST on Rte PRB was struck by an IED at GR 41R QQ 50351 88361. The patrol consisted of four LAV III traveling at a speed of approx 30km/hr. The first vehicle in the order of march (OOM) was struck by the IED and the vehicle was thrown in the air landing upside down facing opposite its original direction of travel (DOT). The blast created a crater 4.89m long by 5m wide with a depth of 1m. The vehicle was equipped with an ECM. The blast resulted in two KIA and 5 WIA. The vehicle was a catastrophic kill. A QRF with EOD was deployed from SP LADY MARIANNE at 1210D* and arrived on scene at 1220D*. During exploitation, EOD found a command wire (CW), running from the SOUTH side of the road to a firing point (FP) approx 60m SOUTH of the blast seat. At the FP, the wire was concealed in the base of the mud wall, running to the blast seat. The FP had excellent cover and concealment from Rte PRB regardless of the close proximity. A possible INS bedding down area was found with vials of an unknown substance approx 10m WEST of the FP. Footprints from boots were found at the FP and it is believed they belonged to the triggerman. It is assessed that the INS had a preplanned egress route that would likely have followed the mud wall from the FP to the small village approx 150m to the NORTHEAST. It is assessed that the IED itself was not placed in the obvious culvert, but approx 2m to the WEST of it, making it difficult to detect during the conduct of a VPS. No evidence was recovered in the blast seat, suggesting that the main charge of the IED was probably multiple A/T blast mines.

(S//REL ISAF, NATO) At 280734D*Sept 09, ANP from PSS WALAKAN and a CF CONVOY were patrolling Rte LAKE EFFECT when the third vehicle in the order of march (OOM), struck an IED at GR 41R QQ 52829 94853. The struck vehicle, A TLAV, was a mobility kill. The strike also resulted in 4 WIA. The OOM was an ANP Ford Ranger with no ECM, an RG-31 with ECM, a T-LAV with no ECM and an RG-31 with ECM ON. The vehicle spacing was approximately 30m. Once the vehicle hit the IED, the turret came off and landed approximately 4m to the left of the vehicle. A route clearance package (RCP) was in the vicinity of the strike and rendered assistance. The US RCP was on site to give help. A QRF from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS) was deployed to investigate and arrived on site at 0807D*. CIED assessed the IED was a VOIED, probably detonated by a PMN AP Mine as no evidence was found on the ground. Judging by the size of the crater, (2.75m by 3.75m with a depth of .85m), it is assessed the main charge was probably an AT Blast Mine. No evidence of plastic jugs was found in the crater. The IED was placed on the right hand side of the road. The IED was emplaced in the area in order to target CF or ANSF vehicles traveling along Rte LAKE EFFECT. Both the ANSF and CF patrol this route daily. CIED concluded their exploitation at 0908D* and returned to CNS at 1152D*.

EOD REPORT:

While conducting air assault with 1 Bravo 3-509th ISO Operation Champion Shield, CIED TM Gardez was notified that ANA on a blocking position found an IED IVO 42SWC1023400930. The CIED TM linked up at the blocking position and was transported to the location. ANA had the area marked and the EOD TL went down range with the Vallon and hook and line. The EOD TL found wires and remotely pulled them. Discovering the wires led to a Pressure Plate but was not connected. The EOD TL then discovered a second Pressure Plate and remotely pulled the Pressure Plate uncovering the power source and wires leading to the TC-6 Anti Tank land mine. After the VOIED was rendered safe, the CIED TM was informed by ANA that they had detained a LN who they believed was associated with placing the IED. ANA told the CIED TM that they were informed by LN children that an IED was being emplaced and they went to investigate and found the detainee next to the IED with a shovel. The ANA was also informed that the Local Nationals had been warned to stay of Route Coyote because an IED would be emplaced. The ANA had not seen any recent vehicle movement on Route Coyote and thus were very suspicious of the man's presence near the suspected IED. CIED TM Gardez, asked the ANA, if they would transfer the detainee over their custody. The ANA agreed to the request, and Fida Mohammed was taken into OEF custody at that time to be processed back at FOB Gardez FHS.",RC EAST,ENEMY,,TF East JOC Watch,1/A,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,42SWC1023400930,33.44773483,69.11011505,TF East JOC Watch,TF East JOC Watch,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

TYPE OF REPORT:             SIGACT                      
DATE OF EVENT:               October 26, 2009, approximately 10:15 am local
LOCATION:                         Nangarhar Hotel, Jalalabad (near the Governor's Palace)
PARTICIPANTS:                 N/A
DESCRIPTION:                   Several explosions and a small arms fire reported in the vicinity of the Nangarhar Hotel, downtown Jalalabad.  Conversations with Nangarhar Governor Gul Agha Sherzai's personal security detachment, and a brief exchange with Governor Sherzai, provided the following details.  Governor Sherzai had just stepped out of his car to attend a bank opening ceremony at the Nangarhar Hotel, when a gunman opened fire from a nearby building.  The PSD returned fire, several grenades were detonated, and the gunman was killed.  Another possible gunman was detained.  The Governor is safe.  Video of the incident may exist.
COMMENTS:                      This speaks to the tenuous nature of security in Nangarhar, the most stable of provinces in this region.  Governor Sherzai right now remains the leading political figure in this area, and his assassination at this critical time would have been a blow to more stable transition of authority post-election.  The fallout of this incident, or who might have targeted the governor, remains unclear.  The Governor is hosting today, and as of 11:00 planned to continue, despite the firefight, a counternarcotics function at the Governor's compound.       

NOTE: This information provided via DOS Officer Doug Jones, who was at the Governor's Palace at the time of the event for the counternarcotics function.

TF PEGASUS SH37/36 reported that while conducting a flying patrol, 2x OH-58 (SH37/36) observed 3 x INS standing to the side of a vehicle in the center of RTE BEAR. The vehicle was providing cover for the INS while they were digging into the road. When the INS heard the OH-58 approaching, two of them got into the vehicle and the third tried to cover up the hole. After he had covered up the hole the third INS got into the vehicle as well and it departed along the road. FF further investigated and confirmed there was a patch of disturbed earth as well as large bags in the rear of the vehicle. FF engaged the vehicle with 11 x 2.75"" HE rockets resulting in 1 x INS killed and the vehicle being disabled. On being outbound from the engagement FF PID 2 x PAX manouevring near the engagement site (PAX were PID as 1 x INS and 1 x child) and FF immediately called cease-fire. The INS and the child moved to the side of the road and hid under a blanket, they were joined by 1 x additional INS and another INS tried to hide under a nearby bush. This last INS was PID as one of the three that were digging in the road earlier. FF maintained PID on the 3 x INS and 1 x child and coordinated ARF and UAV support. 
At 290012D* while waiting for the ARF, FF observed 2 x large explosions from the vehicle (one created a large mushroom cloud and one that burned with white flames).
At 290300D* the ARF arrived on station and established two blocking positions and a fighting position IOT secure the area for the C-EXC and EOD. EOD recovered 1 x AK-47, metal tubing, several large bowls (ressembling pressure cookers) and multiple pressure plates from the burned out vehicle. 
At 290315D* one of the INS that was attempting to hide was spotted by the ARF and the ARF interpreter verbally and visually instructed the INS to identify himself as a non-threat. The INS did not comply and FF fired a warning shot, he then proceeded towards the ARF blocking position and was therefore considered hostile and the ARF fired at the INS. The medic moved in on the wounded INS and was identified as a female and treated for a GSW. MEDEVAC was requested by the ARF (MM(S) 10-28A) but the woman DOW before the MEDEVAC arrived. Meanwhile the fourth INS surrendered to the ARF and a large amount of money, including some Pakistani currency was recovered, as well as a SIM card. He was tactically questioned, appearing nervous and suspicious, but was later released.
